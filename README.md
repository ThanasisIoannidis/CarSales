# CarSales
This is a project i was assigned to do on my first year in university. It is based on a terminal and it helps car retailers automate the demonstration of the cars , car prices, discounts and lastly it stores the data in an xsls file.
The application is really easy to use and has instructions to each step while using it so the user does not get lost.
